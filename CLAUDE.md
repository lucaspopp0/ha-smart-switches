# Most of the files of this project are inside the smart-switches folder

# See @smart-switches/@README.md and @smart-switches/config.yml for project overview and metadata

# The frontend is a React UI located at smart-switches/site, and the backend is a Go server located at smart-switches/server

# After any change to 'smart-switches/server/go.mod' or 'server/go.sum', be sure to tidy those files by running `make -C smart-switches tidy-server` before committing changes to git
